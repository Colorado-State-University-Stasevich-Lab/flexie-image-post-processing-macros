# flexie-image-processing

### This repository is to share ImageJ/FIJI codes for post-processing images from FLEXIE microscope. 


#### FLEXIE_PP_macro_armed-piezo.ijm 
Use this macro for *FULL-SPEED* FLEXIE imaging imaged with an *armed* piezo
This code post-processes a three-dimensional video. 
The end result is that .tiff plus a MaxZ .tiff open in the program. 

*NOTE: input your frames, channels, and slices variables for your specific imaging conditions. *


#### FLEXIE_PP_unarmed-piezo.ijm 
This macro post-processes a FLEXIE *UN-ARMED* piezo Z-stack image
This code post-processes a three-dimensional video. 
The end result is that .tiff plus a MaxZ .tiff open in the program.
